    // Description:

    // When complete, this program will ask the user how many roller coaster rides
    // they'd like to go on, then execute a block of code that many times.
    // The block will output which "ride" they're on, and change which image
    // is displayed on the page. The images shown will cycle through a list
    // of possible sources, though this happens so quickly that the user will only see
    // the final one shown.

    // There are explanatory comments thoughout. The work that still needs to be done
    // is noted in TODO comments. Please complete this work.


    // an array of possible image source values
    var imageSources = [
      "https://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/width-constrained-728/public/503373-iStock-186293315.jpg",
      "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_31/1270023/wonder-woman-roller-coaster-today-inline-170803_7e4934000dfd84cdbb6b2f4900a03988.today-inline-large.jpg",
      "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160520171710-07-stormchaser-jpg-best-coasters-super-169.jpg",
      "https://thediabeticjourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/diabetes-rollercoaster.png"
    ]

    // select the <img> tag with id of "roller" from the HTML
    var theImg = document.querySelector("img#roller");

    // set the src attribute of the img to be the first element in source array
    theImg.setAttribute("src", imageSources[0]);

    // TODO: set howMany variable to a value user inputs
    var howMany = prompt("How many times to ride?");

    var counter = 1;

    // TODO extra: on h1, set class to "red"
    document.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0].setAttribute("class", "red");
    
    // TODO extra: Execute the loop only half as many times as the user requested.
//    howMany = howMany / 2;

    // TODO extra: Execute the loop twice as many times as the user requested.
//    howMany = howMany * 2;    
    
    // TODO: execute this loop the number of times user requested
    while(counter <= howMany){
      console.log("Wheee! This is the ", counter, " time we've done this!");

      // find value of counter modulo length of sources array-
      // this value will increase by one on each iteration of the loop,
      // so image source will cycle through all possible images
      var theOne = counter % imageSources.length;
      // reset the src of the image to the next member of the sources array
      theImg.setAttribute("src", imageSources[theOne]);

      // TODO: increment the counter
      counter++;
    }
    
    // EXTRA CHALLENGES:
    // 1. Using JS, add a class of "red" to the <h1>. DONE
    //    This only needs to be done once, so code should be outside loop.
    // 2. Execute the loop only half as many times, or twice as many times, as the user requested. DONE
    // 3. Add a pause to each loop, so user can see each image as it cycles past.
    //    This is a difficult one!  TRIED calling a pause function in loop, 
    //    but the image went blank during looping and then the final image appeared.
